# Ozone

This directory contains a template configuration for the debugging
tool Ozone by Segger. It is automatically converted into a working project
configuration by the waf tool ``f_ozone.py`` if the binary of the debugging
software has been found on the system.

For more information on using this, please search the foxBMS documentation
for `Ozone`.
