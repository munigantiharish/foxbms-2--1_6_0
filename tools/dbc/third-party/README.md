# Third Party DBC Files

- Third party DBC files are copied into the repository verbatim.
- When messages are needed for the foxBMS project, the required messages,
  signals etc. are copied to the ``tools/dbc/foxbms.sym`` and
  ``tools/dbc/foxbms.dbc`` as needed as described in [tools/dbc/README.md](../README.md)
