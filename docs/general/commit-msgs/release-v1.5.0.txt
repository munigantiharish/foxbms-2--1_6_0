Minor release of foxBMS 2 (v1.5.0)

* Added hardware design files (e.g., schematics, layout, BOM and STEP file
  etc.) for the NXP MC33775A monitoring IC.
* Now CAN messages with extended identifier can be transmitted and received.
* The default interface configuration for BMS-Slaves is the interface 1 on the
  BMS-Interfaces:
  - for LTC-based interfaces: hardware chip select 1 on SPI 1
  - for NXP-based interfaces: hardware chip select 1 on SPI 1
* The chip select configuration has been unified.
* Applied the OS abstraction strictly to make the BMS application fully
  OS agnostic.
* The software version is now saved in FRAM version struct. As this is The
  the first FRAM entry, this changes the memory layout and makes FRAM entries
  existing prior to this version invalid.
* The FRAM can now be initialized/reinitialized via CAN.
* Added a magic CAN messages sequence that is sent on startup.
* Added driver for the PCF2131 RTC.
  The driver uses I2C to communicate with the IC.
* Added a basic GUI to interact with the BMS via CAN from PC-side.
* Maintenance:
  * Update the Axivion static code analysis to version 7.5.0.
