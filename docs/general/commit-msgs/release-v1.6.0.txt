Minor release of foxBMS 2 (v1.6.0)

* foxBMS now supports the ADI ADES1830 AFE.
* The default FreeRTOS behavior for foxBMS 2 is now to check for stack
  overflows. The BMS still tries to send a CAN message about the occurred
  problem.
* The BMS tried to precharge a infinite times. This setting is now controlled
  by setting `BMS_PRECHARGE_TRIES` to a meaningful, finite number (needs to
  be defined by the user as part of the application setup)
* The calculation of the string power has been fixed.
* The SOX database entry has been split into SOC, SOH, and SOE to simplify
  adding further estimations.
